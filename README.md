jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Trigger Dokploy Deployment
        uses: zhaolion/dokploy-action@0.0.4
        with:
          api_token: ${{ secrets.DOKPLOY_API_TOKEN }}
          application_id: ${{ secrets.DOKPLOY_APPLICATION_ID }}
          dokploy_url: ${{ secrets.DOKPLOY_URL }}
          deploy_title: "[Deploy][${{ github.ref_name }}][${{ github.sha }}]"
          deploy_message: "Deployed branch: ${{ github.ref_name }} ${{ github.sha }} at ${{ github.event.head_commit.timestamp }}"
```

Note: If you encounter persistent 403 errors, it might be related to Cloudflare bot detection blocking the requests, so itâ€™s worth checking on that separately.
